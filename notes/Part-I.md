# Part 1: THE BASICS

An algorithm is a well-defined set of rules for transforming an input into an output. The input and output are part of the problem definition and are data. Data is a concrete representation of information and this input/output data structures the algorithm. The algorithm is a problem-solving method and methods whose inputs and outputs are equal are interchangeable.

Outstanding questions and needs:

* Have explanation of how data structures algorithms and have concrete examples ready.
* Think about how the interchangeability of algorithms may be related to referential transparency and compositional reasoning.

**Whiteboard walkthru**

1. Define the problem by identifying the input and output.
2. Discuss the input and output as data.
3. Hopefully explain how the input and output structures the method of solution.
4. Provide a variety of interchangeable solutions.
