# Part 1: THE BASICS

An algorithm is a well-defined set of rules for transforming an input into an output. The input and output of the algorithm are part of the problem definition and are data. Data is a concrete representation of information and this input/output data structures the algorithm. The algorithm is a problem-solving method and methods whose inputs and outputs are equal are interchangeable.

Outstanding questions and needs:

* Have explanation of how data structures algorithms and have concrete examples ready.
* Think about how the interchangeability of algorithms may be related to referential transparency and compositional reasoning.
